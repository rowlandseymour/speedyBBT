Description: A suite of functions that allow a full, fast, and efficient Bayesian treatment of the Bradley--Terry model. 
             Prior assumptions about the model parameters can be encoded through a multivariate normal prior distribution. 
             Inference is performed using a latent variable representation of the model.
