\description{
This function fits the Bradley-Terry model with comparison  and player
specific effects. Each comparison can be assigned a real value to allow for a
specific effect for the comparison, such as bias, ordering or home/away effect.
The value of this effect is denoted $\kappa$. The player specific effects are
described through a formula and data.frame containing the value. The function
places a normal prior distribution on both kappa and the player specific
parameters $\beta$.
}
\details{
If \code{player.prior.var} is omitted, independent and identical
N(0, 5^2) prior distributions are placed on each object quality parameter.

If \code{beta.initial}is omitted, it is set to a vector of zeroes.

If \code{kappa.var} is omitted, it is set to N(0, 5^2), if \code{kappa.intial} is omitted
it is set to 0.5.
