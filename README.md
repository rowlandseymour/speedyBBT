## Efficient Bayesian Inference for the Bradley--Terry Model

ðŸ“¦ The `speedyBBT` R package allows you to perform fast and efficient Bayesian inference for the Bradley--Terry model. The package estimates the object qualities using a data augmentation method with Polya-Gamma prior distributions. This makes carrying out a Bayesian analysis of comparative judgement data quick and easy.

## Installation

You can install `speedyBBT` by calling the following commands:

```{r}
install.packages("speedyBBT")
#devtools::install_github("rowlandseymour/BSBT", dependencies = TRUE) #for development version
```

## Usage
The code chunks below show how to use the package to fit the Bradley--Terry model
to a data set relating to forced marriage. Judges were shown pairs of wards and asked 
which had a higher rate of forced marriage. We can use the `speedyBBTm` function
to draw samples for the full conditional distributions for the ward quality parameters.
We place a multivariate normal prior distribution on the ward quality parameters. 
The covariance matrix of this prior distribution is contstucted using a network
representation of the wards in Nottinghamshire. 

```{r}
#View Data
data("forcedMarriage", package = "speedyBBT")
head(forcedMarriage$comparisons)


#Construct covariance matrix
expA  <- expm::expm(forcedMarriage$adjacencyMatrix)
sigma <- diag(diag(expA)^-0.5) %*% expA %*% diag(diag(expA)^-0.5)
    
#Fit model
forcedMarriageModel <- speedyBBTm(outcome = rep(1, length(forcedMarriage$comparisons$win)),
                                  player1 = forcedMarriage$comparisons$win, 
                                  player2 = forcedMarriage$comparisons$lost, 
                                  player.prior.var = sigma)
forcedMarriageModel$lambda  <- forcedMarriageModel$lambda - rowMeans(forcedMarriageModel$lambda)

#View Trace Plots
plot(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[, 10], type = 'l',
     xlab = "Iteration", ylab = expression(lambda[10]))
plot(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[, 20], type = 'l', 
     xlab = "Iteration", ylab = expression(lambda[20]))
plot(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[, 30], type = 'l', 
     xlab = "Iteration", ylab = expression(lambda[30]))
plot(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[, 40], type = 'l', 
     xlab = "Iteration", ylab = expression(lambda[40]))

plot(forcedMarriageModel$alpha.sq, type = 'l')

#View Results
forcedMarriageModelMeans <- colMeans(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[-c(1:50), ])
forcedMarriageModelLowerCI <- apply(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[-c(1:50), ], 2, quantile, 0.025)
forcedMarriageModelUpperCI <- apply(forcedMarriageModel$lambda[-c(1:50), ], 2, quantile, 0.975)
forcedMarriageResults <- data.frame("ward" = forcedMarriage$wards$NAME,
                                    "mean" = forcedMarriageModelMeans,
                                    "lowerCI" = forcedMarriageModelLowerCI, 
                                    "upperCI" = forcedMarriageModelUpperCI)
forcedMarriageResults <- forcedMarriageResults[order(forcedMarriageResults$mean), ]

plot(forcedMarriageResults$mean, xlab = "Ward", ylab = "Posterior Mean", ylim = c(-7.5, 7.5))
segments(x0 = 1:nrow(forcedMarriageResults), y0 = forcedMarriageResults$lowerCI, 
         y1 = forcedMarriageResults$upperCI)
