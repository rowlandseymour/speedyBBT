## Efficient Bayesian Inference for the Bradley--Terry Model
ðŸ“¦ The `speedyBBT` R package allows you to perform fast and efficient Bayesian inference for the Bradley--Terry model. The package estimates the object qualities using a data augmentation method with Polya-Gamma prior distributions. This makes carrying out a Bayesian analysis of comparative judgement data quick and easy.


## Installation
You can install `speedyBBT` by calling the following commands:
```{r}
install.packages("speedyBBT")
#devtools::install_github("rowlandseymour/BSBT", dependencies = TRUE) #for development version
```
